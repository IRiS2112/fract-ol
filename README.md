# Fract-ol

Fract-ol is a simple program that generates and displays mathematical fractals like **Mandelbrot** and **Julia**. It provides interactive controls for exploring these fractals in detail.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

## ðŸ“œ Features
- Supports different fractal types: **Mandelbrot**, **Julia**.
- Interactive navigation:
  - **Zoom in/out** using the mouse wheel.
  - **Move around** with arrow keys.
  - **Modify Julia parameters** in real time.
- Smooth coloring algorithms for better visualization.

## ðŸ“– What This Project Covers
- Understanding the mathematics behind fractals.
- Working with MiniLibX for graphics rendering.
- Handling user input and events for interaction.
- Optimizing performance using multi-threading.
